1]  Bus Topology:  All Computers Connected to Centeral Cable
  Advantages:-
    1-  Inexpensive (cheap)  
    2-  Easy to install

  Disadvantages:-
    1-  Low Performance
    2-  Limited Computers    (To avoid Data Collision)
    3-  Low Fault Tolerance   (if the there is data collision in the cable,  the network will be down)    (Fault Tolerance مصطلح بنستخدمه مع امكانية لشبكة او السيستم انه يفضل شغال مع وجود  اخطاء او مشاكل)
    4-  Less Secure  (The message is Broadcasting to all Devices)


2]  Ring Topology:    Computers Connected in A Circle
  Advantages:-
  1-  Easy To install  
  2-  No data Collision

  Disadvantages:-
    1-  Low Transmit  (becuase the message will move in the Circle until it reach to the distination)
    2-  Low Fault Tolerance  (if one device down  =>  All Network will be down)
    3-  Difficult to Reconfigure    (if want to add or remove device from the network, it will be difficult)

3]  Mesh Topology:-  Redundant Topology
  Advantages:-
    1-  NO Fault Tolerance
    2-  More Secure  (Point to point Devices)
    3-  No Data Collision
  Disadvantages:-
    1-  Very High Cost
    2-  Difficult To Install
    3-  Difficult to Troubleshoot and Manage

4-  Start Topology  (Common use):-  Devices Connected via  Central Device (Switch)
  Advantages:-
    1-  Inexpensive
    2-  Scalability    (Add/Remove any device to/from the Network)
  Disadvantages:-
    1-  Single point of Failure  (if the Central Device (S.W) is down,  then the All Network will be Down)
        Solution  =>  and we can fix it using another S.W,  if the Primary S.W is down,  then there will be another Switch
