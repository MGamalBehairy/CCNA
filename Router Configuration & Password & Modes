then install puTTy  from putty.org    to open CLI  of the Router and configure it

3-  Router(config)#  "Global Configure" mode       , Router#  configure terminal  (conf t)


to print all comands u can use in the mode  type "?"
Router#  ?      => it will show all Commands u can execute

Router#  e?    =>  will show all comands started with "e"


====>  set Password in Global Mode  (Password is case-sensetive)
R(config)#  enable password  test                          The Password is Clear Text,  if u rum command   "show running-config"  it will show the password


=====>  Types of Configuration in Router
  1-  Running-Config                                               ,  if u restarted the router,  the configuraion will be "Deleted"
  2-  Startup-config      =>  Located in NVRAM (Non-violated-Ram)  ,  if u restarted the router, the configuration will still "Exist"

Router#  show running-config
Router#  show startup-config    =>  output  file startup-config doesn't exist

===>  to save the running-config  to   "Startup-Configuration"
Router#  write    OR    
Router#  write memory
Router#  copy running-config startup-config

====>  Encrypt Password  
Router#  service password-encryption        => it will Encrypt password with  Type "7"    and its very weak,  can decrypt it easily

Router#  enable secret  Mohamed
Router(config)#  do show running-config          =>  (do  => to excecute command in "Privileged" Mode and u are on "Global Configuration mode")
Now the Password is Encrypted  with  "MD5"  Encryption  , Very Strong


if u applied "password" and "secret",    then to login just use "secret" Not "password",    becase "secret" is stringer than "passsword"
