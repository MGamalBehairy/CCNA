Switeches are Connected via "RJ45"  Register Jack 45
10 Base-T  =>  10M bitsper/sec,  T  =>  Twisted Pair cableing
Maximum Length  =  100m


Why are Wires Twisted?
=>  To reduse the Magbetic Field



1] Straigt-through Cable  (PC, Router  to S.W):-
Pair(1,2  &  3,6)
1,2   Transimitter (Pc)       ==>    1,2      Receiver (S.W)
3,6   Receiver  (PC)          ==>    3,6      Transmiter (S.W)


2] Cross-over Cable    (NOT Used in Modern Devices)
PC,Router  to  PC,Router
1,2  (TX)      TO    3,6  (RX)
3,6  (RX)      TO    1,2  (TX)

because  pin 1,2  is responsible for just transmittiong  NOT Receiving,    so the Destination can't Receive with pin 1,2.    so  we  it will change 1,2  to 3,6

Now, The Modern Devices use    "Auto MDI-X"  it use Straigh-through cable  and can recognize if the device is router,pc OR S.W  and transmit and Receive

----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Fiber Optics  ------------------------------------------------
Fiber Opticts Not use RJ 45,  but instead use " SFP Transceiver "  to Connect to S.W    (Small Form-Factor Pluggable)
the Data is in form "Light Signal"
there are 2 Wires  (One For Transmit    and   one for Receiver)

types OF Optical Fiber:-
1)  Multi-mode
      Small Distance
      Cheap
      LED Based
      The Core diameter is large

2)  Single Mode
    Large Distance
    Expensive
    Laser
    Core is very tiny


8  bits = 1 byte
