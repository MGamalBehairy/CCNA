------------------------  Netowrk  Components  -------------------
1-  End Devices   (PCs, Laptops, Phones,....)
2-  Network Media (Cable, Wirless Connection)
3-  Network Interface  (Transfere the Data from 0,1  to  Elertic Signal "Incase of Copper Cable used"  OR Light Signal  "incase of Optical Fiber Cable"  OR  "Radio Frequency incase of Wireless")
=====>  Cables
1] Copper Cables
  1)  Coaxial Cable        (Used in TVs,  Container From  "Core, Isolation Layer,  Outer Jacket")
  2)  Twisted Paoer Cable  (CAT 5 "100 Mbit/s", CAT5e "1000 Mbits/s  OR  1Gbits/s",  CAT6 "10Gbits/s")

Connected with  RJ45 ,  with Long Distand  100 m

2]  Optical Fiber
  Trasfer Light ray    (Containre From   "Core made from Glass OR Plastic"  ,  Cladding "To not allow the signal to Leak outside the core,  Kevelar Fiber  ,  Outer Jacket ) 
  -  High Speed  "Light Speed"
